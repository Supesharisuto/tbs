# TBS[13]: OpenFaaS

Dan is joined this week by [Alex Ellis](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk), the
founder and maintainer of [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/). On a [previous
episode](../9/README.md) we demoed two of Alex's other projects,
[Inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets) and
[k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup). Today we will take a look at how
Crossplane can be used alongside OpenFaaS to deploy and consume managed services
alongside your serverless functions!
