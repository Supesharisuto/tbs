# TBS[17]: NATS

Dan is joined this week by [Derek Collison](https://twitter.com/derekcollison),
the founder and CEO of [Synadia](https://synadia.com/) and creator of
[NATS](https://nats.io/). NATS is a simple, secure, and high performance open
source messaging system for cloud native applications, IoT messaging, and
microservices architectures. Dan and Derek will dive into how NATS works, its
relationship with Kubernetes, and how it can be used alongside
[Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) to provide powerful solutions for end
users.
