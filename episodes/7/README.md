# TBS[7]: Lost in Translation

TBS is back and this is going to be a good one! Muvaffak will be joining
Daniel to talk through how we translate provider APIs into schemas for our
managed resource CRDs. Muvaffak is the author of the Crossplane Managed
Resource API Patterns design standard
<https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/design/one-pager-managed-resource-api-design.md>
and a core contributor to the Crossplane project!
