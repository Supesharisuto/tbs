# TBS[15]: Knative

Dan is joined by [Matt Moore](https://twitter.com/mattomata), the co-founder,
TOC member, and Serving Lead of the [Knative](https://knative.dev/) project, for
this special Friday episode of TBS. They will take a look at the foundations of
Knative, then dive into consuming managed services provisioned by
[Crossplane](https://crossplane.io) in your Knative services. They'll also chat
a bit about binding, duck-types, and other Kubernetes controller patterns that
are used across both projects.

Hosts: [@hasheddan](https://twitter.com/hasheddan) and [Matt
