# TBS[18]: Adding Cloud Pub/Sub Support to provider-gcp

Dan is joined by fellow Crossplane maintainer [Muvaffak Onuş](https://twitter.com/muvaffakonus) to add [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) support to [provider-gcp](https://github.com/crossplane/provider-gcp). They will write all the code to be able to provision a new Pub/Sub topic using [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/), detailing design decisions made along the way. The show will wrap up with opening a PR to include Pub/Sub support in the next provider-gcp release!
