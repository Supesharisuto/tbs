# TBS[16]: Velero

Dan is joined this week by [Carlisia Campos](https://twitter.com/carlisia) and
[Nolan Brubaker](https://twitter.com/palendae), engineers and maintainers on the
[Velero](https://velero.io/) project. Velero allows you to backup and migrate
Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes. [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io)
recently underwent architectural updates to allow its users to backup and
restore their managed service resources across clusters using Velero. With these
changes, users may now snapshot the state of their cloud provider
infrastructure, and restore it in the case of cluster failure. We will take a
look at how Velero enables this functionality, as well as how the project
supports other use-cases across the Kubernetes ecosystem.
