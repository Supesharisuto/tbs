# TBS[19]: Falco

Dan is joined this week by [Dan “POP” Papandrea](https://twitter.com/danpopnyc),
Field Chief Technologist at [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) and host of The
[POPCAST with DanPOP](https://popcast-d9f7b6dc.simplecast.com/) podcast.
Sysdig's open source [Falco](https://falco.org/) project is a member of the CNCF
focused on providing cloud native runtime security. Sysdig helps companies
integrate that security into their DevOps workflows, allowing them to deploy to
production faster and with more confidence. Dan and Pop will take a look at how
Falco and Sysdig can be used to secure infrastructure environments provisioned
by [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io).
